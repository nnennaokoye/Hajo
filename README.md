# Hajoo 🌍  
### Bringing Africa’s Trusted Savings Circles Onchain  

**Hajoo** is a decentralized community savings and payout platform built on **Hedera**, designed to bring Africa’s age-old group savings system — known as *Ajo*, *Esusu*, *Stokvel*, or *Chama* — into the digital age.  
It enables trusted circles to automate contributions, payouts, and transparency using smart contracts.  

---

## 🚀 Overview  

Across Africa, millions of people rely on informal savings groups to pool money and support one another.  
While these systems foster trust and cooperation, they often face problems like missed payments, fraud, and lack of transparency.  

**Hajoo solves this by putting savings groups onchain.**  
Funds are managed by smart contracts — not people — ensuring automation, transparency, and fairness for everyone.

## 💡 Current Features  

### 🔐 Onchain Trust  
Every group is governed by a smart contract escrow.  
No central collector. No manual records. Just code enforcing group rules.  

### ⚡ Automated Contributions & Payouts  
Contributions and payouts happen automatically on schedule — no delays, no disputes.  

### 📊 Transparent Tracking  
Every transaction is verifiable onchain, ensuring full visibility for all group members.  

### 💰 Rotational Savings (MVP)  
- **Rotational Mode** – Members take turns receiving payouts.  
  
Additional modes (Target/Flexible) are planned in the roadmap.  

### 🔗 Wallet Connect  
Connect with WalletConnect AppKit and manage contributions from the dashboard.  

### 🌐 Accessibility  
Supports multiple wallets and will integrate **zkLogin** for social/email onboarding.

## 🧩 Why Onchain?  

Hajoo is built onchain to solve trust and transparency issues in traditional savings systems.  
- **Smart contracts** manage funds safely and automatically.  
- **Transparency** ensures every member can verify group activity.  
- **Global participation** allows members anywhere to join and contribute.  

We’re not eliminating traditional savings circles — we’re **redefining them** and **onboarding communities into a secure, inclusive, and borderless financial system.**

## 🧠 Challenges  

During development, we ran into:  
- **State management issues** when trying to display groups for a newly added member.  
- **Mock token limitations** while testing payment flows.  
- **Time constraints**, which limited some UI and integration polish.  

These will be improved as we continue to refine the project.
